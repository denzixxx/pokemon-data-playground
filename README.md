# Pokémon Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and data analysis projects based on Pokémon-related datasets. The aim is to explore various ML methods including classification, regression, clustering, and neural networks — using both **R** and **Python**.

The Pokémon theme provides an engaging and consistent base for experimenting with data-driven modeling techniques in both supervised and unsupervised learning.
